# BRANCH_AND_COMMIT_POLICY

## Branch Naming

- `feat/<short-topic>`
- `fix/<short-topic>`
- `chore/<short-topic>`

## Commit Rules

1. Keep commits small and isolated to one problem chain.
2. Use imperative commit messages.
3. Include evidence links in commit or PR description when possible.

## Safety Rules

1. Never rewrite unrelated history.
2. Never revert changes you do not own unless explicitly requested.
3. Prefer additive changes and reversible diffs.
